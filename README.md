# Majora's Mask Randomizer
This is a Majora's Mask Randomzier created by 95Shade.
This Randomizer is based of off [DeathBasket](https://www.twitch.tv/deathbasket)'s old Randomizer where each item (not item location) is randomized; For example, red potion from two different shops will give the same thing.
If rupees are randomized. then they will give the new item from any place where it plays the Get Item animation; Otherwise, it will give itself (a green rupee from a bush will give a green rupee).
The first Red Potion gotten from the witch will always be a Bottle of Red Potion, the rest will be what Red Potion gives.
Some bottle items give an  extra bottle with them if the Get Item animation plays (Milk, Poe, Chateau Romani, and Gold Dust)
## Changes from Vanilla
- Skips the intro, starts in South Clock Town
- Start with the items Deku Mask and Song of Healing give
- Start with Song of Time and Ocarina
- Can always get the item from Fierce Deity Mask on the moon (does not check if completed the trials)
